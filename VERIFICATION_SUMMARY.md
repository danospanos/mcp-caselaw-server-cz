# MCP Server - Search Functionality Verification

## Summary

The MCP Caselaw Server already implements the `search_ak_vrana` tool that can search the ak-vrana.cz website for any keywords, including "odcizeni".

## What Was Done

### 1. Verified Existing Implementation
- ✅ The `search_ak_vrana` tool is already implemented in `server.py`
- ✅ The tool is properly registered with the FastMCP framework
- ✅ The implementation correctly handles:
  - Keyword search on ak-vrana.cz
  - HTML parsing to extract article information
  - Error handling for network and parsing issues
  - JSON response formatting

### 2. Added Supporting Files

#### `.gitignore`
- Prevents Python cache files and build artifacts from being committed
- Follows Python best practices

#### `demo_search.py`
- Standalone demonstration script
- Shows how the search functionality works
- Can be run independently to test the search for "odcizeni"
- Usage: `python demo_search.py`

#### `verify_tools.py`
- Verifies that MCP tools are properly registered
- Confirms both `search_ak_vrana` and `extract_page_content` are available
- Usage: `python verify_tools.py`

#### `SEARCH_GUIDE.md`
- Complete guide on how to search for "odcizeni" using the MCP server
- Covers multiple usage methods:
  1. Using the MCP server with an MCP client (recommended)
  2. Using the demo script for testing
  3. Direct API calls
- Includes expected responses and troubleshooting tips

## How to Search for "odcizeni"

### Quick Start

1. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Use an MCP client** (like Claude Desktop) to call:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "search_ak_vrana",
     "arguments": {
       "keywords": "odcizeni"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Or run the demo:**
   ```bash
   python demo_search.py
   ```

### Expected Result

The tool returns JSON with:
- Search query and URL
- Total articles and links found
- Array of articles with text and links
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "query": "odcizeni",
    "url": "https://ak-vrana.cz/?s=odcizeni",
    "total_articles": 10,
    "total_links": 45,
    "articles": [...]
  }
  ```

## Verification

Run `verify_tools.py` to confirm:
```bash
$ python verify_tools.py
